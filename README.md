# behavior_timestamps
### Matlab class for storing and analyzing timestamps of behavior data
There is a live script (notebook) named demo_BehaviorData.mlx that you can use to get started with the class. A few examples are included.

Many of the methods are focused on analyzing licking behavior. However, almost all the methods simply make calculations or graphs on the timestamps of interest. If your timestamps correspond to entries into a port, lever presses, or other events, you can easily adapt the class to your needs.
